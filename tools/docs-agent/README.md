# Short-lived documentation agents

Guardrails uses separate short-lived Pi sandboxes for post-merge documentation authoring, release
documentation authoring, and pull request documentation review. A sandbox exists only for one
workflow job and is deleted after the agent finishes or fails. The workflows do not provide the
sandbox with a GitHub token or the upstream model credential.

The trusted host embeds `AGENTS.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`, `AI_POLICY.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` in each
agent task. The checked-in Writing Style Guide therefore reaches every author and reviewer sandbox
without a dependency on an external skill collection.

## Repository configuration

Repository administrators must configure:

- a `docs-agent-inference` GitHub Environment restricted to the `develop` branch;
- the `DOCS_AGENT_API_KEY` environment secret, using an NVIDIA NGC service key that grants only the
  required NIM API endpoint access and has a bounded expiration;
- the `DOCS_MAINTAINERS` Actions variable as a comma-separated list of GitHub usernames that should
  review generated fast-follow and release documentation pull requests.

Do not keep a duplicate repository-level or organization-level `DOCS_AGENT_API_KEY` secret. Rotate
the service key on a regular schedule and immediately after any suspected disclosure. Enabling a
required reviewer on the environment adds a human approval gate to every model-bearing job,
including post-merge and release documentation runs.

Enable a `develop` branch ruleset that requires pull requests, code-owner approval, and required
status checks for changes to the credential boundary named in `.github/CODEOWNERS`. Also enable the
GitHub Actions policy that requires every action to use a full commit SHA.

The authoring workflows run their pre-publication documentation checks without a Fern credential.
The existing docs build and publishing workflows continue to own `DOCS_FERN_TOKEN`; this automation
does not read or expose that secret.

The OpenShell release archives, Pi sandbox image, model identifier, rubric copies, and workflow
actions are pinned by checksum, digest, version, or full commit SHA in the repository. Update these
pins through normal dependency and security review.

The repository exposes only public routing metadata: the NVIDIA API base URL, the selected model
identifier, the local `inference.local` route, and the Actions secret name. The secret value is not
stored in Git, workflow arguments, prompts, model configuration, artifacts, or pull requests. GitHub
injects it as `OPENAI_API_KEY` only into the trusted `Configure isolated inference` step. That step
passes the value to `openshell provider create` through the subprocess environment, while the command
line names only the environment variable. Every OpenShell command receives a credential-free
environment except that one provider-registration call. Later sandbox execution steps do not receive
the secret at all.

The runtime rejects non-loopback gateway endpoints. The gateway binds to runner loopback, keeps its
process marker, configuration, and log files under `RUNNER_TEMP` with owner-only permissions, and
routes sandbox model traffic through
`https://inference.local/v1`. The Pi configuration contains the inert value `unused`, not the provider
credential. Provider registration suppresses command output while the credential is present. Every
model-bearing workflow stops the complete gateway process group and removes its temporary state
immediately after the agent phase. The hosted runner provides a second cleanup boundary when the job
ends.

## Post-merge fast follow

`Docs / Author Post-Merge Fast Follow` runs when a non-documentation pull request merges into
`develop`. The selection job records the source pull request number, author, exact base and head
commits, and merge commit. It does not use a release tag or an earlier managed documentation pull
request as a range boundary.

The model-bearing job performs these steps:

1. Prepare the merged tree and the exact source pull request diff as inert data.
2. Start a fresh author sandbox with no direct network access.
3. Permit writes only while authoring and restrict the exported patch to `docs/**`, `fern/docs.yml`,
   and `fern/assets/**`.
4. Start a second, read-only sandbox to review the exact source diff and candidate patch.
5. Run host-side documentation validation when the approved patch is not empty.
6. Delete each sandbox and upload a revision-bound artifact.

The separate publisher has GitHub write permission but receives neither the model credential nor a
model sandbox. It applies the approved patch to the current `develop` branch, creates one draft pull
request for the triggering development pull request, and requests review from the configured
maintainers and the development pull request author. An empty approved patch creates no pull request.
The branch includes the source pull request number and merge commit, so different development pull
requests never accumulate into the same documentation pull request.

Release preparation pull requests are excluded from this generic workflow and are handled by the
release-specific workflow.

## Release documentation

`Docs / Prepare Release Documentation` is the documentation stage that follows `Prepare Release`.
The release workflow first creates a bot-authored `chore/release-X.Y.Z` pull request. After
maintainers merge that release preparation into `develop`, the documentation workflow verifies the
bot author, stable version, `release` and `automated` labels, exact generated file set, source
revisions, merge commit, and merge time.

The short-lived author uses the generated changelog and merged release tree to update exactly:

- `docs/about/release-notes.mdx` with the current release summary and Previous Releases links;
- `fern/docs.yml` with the immutable version entry; and
- `docs/README.mdx` with the current versioning example.

The author must include every generated breaking change and must not upgrade the Fern CLI. A second,
read-only sandbox checks the release summary, links, version entry, snapshot name, file boundary, and
source grounding. The trusted host creates a local snapshot tag and runs the documentation script
tests and strict Fern validation before publishing anything.

The write-enabled publisher recreates the approved snapshot as a deterministic commit whose parent
is the merged release commit. It pushes the annotated, immutable
`fern-docs-snapshot-vX.Y.Z` tag before opening one draft release documentation pull request. The pull
request is labeled `documentation`, `release`, and `automated`, and requests review from the
configured maintainers. A release preparation PR is never handled cumulatively with ordinary
post-merge documentation.

## Documentation review

`Docs / Review Documentation` runs automatically when an eligible same-repository pull request, or a
pull request from an owner, member, or collaborator, changes public documentation or its checked-in
build and navigation surfaces. An external fork pull request requires an owner, member, or
collaborator to add a pull request comment containing exactly `/review-doc`. Maintainers can use
manual workflow dispatch with a pull request number. This gate prevents anonymous pull requests from
consuming the repository's inference quota without maintainer authorization.

The workflow checks out trusted reviewer code from the base revision and prepares the pull request as
inert data. The Pi sandbox mounts the pull request read-only, has no direct network policy, and receives
only read, search, and output-writing tools. It must not execute repository scripts, tests, package
managers, or changed workflow code.

The reviewer selects the task-guide, concept-guide, or API-reference rubric that matches the primary
changed content. The six weighted dimensions total 100 points. Hard-gate findings force a failing
decision; lower-confidence or below-threshold results use `human-review`. The trusted host validates
the score arithmetic, rubric maxima, hard gates, finding locations, and exact pull request revision.

A separate publisher rechecks the pull request head and posts or replaces one advisory comment. The
comment includes the score, dimension table, rationale, findings, reviewed commit, and workflow link.
The review never approves, requests changes, merges, labels, or pushes to the pull request.

## Recovery

- If the source branch, merge commit, or pull request head no longer matches the artifact, rerun the
  workflow. The publisher refuses stale output.
- If a managed documentation branch exists without an open pull request, inspect and remove or recover
  that exact branch before rerunning. The publisher does not overwrite it.
- Never move or replace a published `fern-docs-snapshot-vX.Y.Z` tag. If review finds a correction
  after publication, create a new snapshot commit and use `-r2`, `-r3`, and later suffixes as described
  in `docs/README.mdx`.
- If a release snapshot tag exists but its managed pull request does not, inspect the exact tag and
  managed branch. A rerun proceeds only when the deterministic snapshot commit still matches.
- If a sandbox cleanup fails, remove only the sandbox named in the workflow log before rerunning.
- If inference is unavailable, the model-bearing job fails closed and publishes no patch or review.
- If the configured maintainer list is empty or invalid, publication stops before creating a branch.
