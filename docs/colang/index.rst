Colang (|VERSION|)
=====================

.. Colang is an event-based modeling language to enable the design of highly flexible conversational interactions between a human and a bot. Since learning a new language is not an easy task, Colang was designed as a mix of natural language and python. If you are familiar with python, you should feel confident using Colang after seeing a few examples, even without any explanation. Under the hood Colang scripts are interpreted by a Python runtime that is currently part of `NeMo Guardrails <https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails>`_ (|NEMO_GUARDRAILS_VERSION|).
