Introduction
----------------------------------------

Like Python, Colang supports these fundamental data types: `string`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, `set`, `dict`, in addition to the Colang specific event, action and flow references. We have already seen how to assign event, action and flow references to a variable using the ``... as $ref`` notation. Here ``$ref`` is also just a variable. To enable whitespace characters in flow names Colang variables must always start with the ``$`` character and cannot contain whitespace characters themselves.

.. important::
    Variable naming convention:

    - Has to start with an alphabetic character
    - Can contain alphanumeric characters including ``_``
    - Is case sensitive

    .. code-block:: text

        Regular expression: \$[^\W\d]\w*

Variables in Colang behave exactly like in Python. As a consequence, mutable data types like a list will not be copied for a new variable assignment but only referenced by the new variable.

.. code-block:: colang
    :caption: variables/assignment/main.co

    flow main
        $value = "Hi"
        $value_copy = $value # Copy of the value
        await UtteranceBotAction(script=$value_copy)
        match AnEvent()

Note, that Colang references are also mutable and therefore point to the same underlying object:

.. code-block:: colang
    :caption: variables/references/main.co

    flow main
        match UtteranceUserAction.Finished() as $ref
        $ref_copy = $ref # Both references are pointing to same event object
        await UtteranceBotAction(script=$ref_copy.final_transcript)
        match AnEvent()

Currently, the creation of references of other variables is not supported. References can only point to event, action or flow objects and are created in ``send``, ``match``, ``start`` or ``await`` statements using the ``as`` keyword.

.. important::

    - Assignment to variables will always create a copy of the value in memory
    - Copy of event, action or flow references keep pointing to the same object
    - Flow parameters are passed by value

Here are some variable assignment examples:

.. code-block:: colang

    $string_value = "Hi"
    $integer_value = 42
    $float_value = 3.14159
    $list_of_strings = ["one", "two", "three"]
    $list_of_integers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    $set_of_floats = {0.1, 0.2, 0.3}
    $dictionary = {"value_a":1, "value_b": 2}
    $multiline_string_value = """This is a list of options:
      A) Item A
      B) Item B"""

Alternatively, for string and multiline string expressions, single quote characters ``'`` and ``'''`` can be used instead of double quotes.

----------------------------------------
Expression Evaluation
----------------------------------------

Colang supports evaluation of common Python expressions for simple and compound data types (see `Simple Eval <https://github.com/danthedeckie/simpleeval>`_):

.. code-block:: colang

    # Arithmetic expressions
    21 + 21
    21 + 19 / 7 + (8 % 3) ** 9

    # Supported operators
    +, -, *, / # standard arithmetic operators
    ** # to the power of: 2 ** 10 -> 1024
    % # modulus
    ==, <, >, <=, >= # comparison operators
    in # is something contained within something else
    not in # is something not contained within something else
    >>, <<, ^, |, &, ~ # Bitwise operators

    # Conditional expressions
    "equal" if x == y else "not equal"
    "a" if 1 == 2 else "b" if 2 == 3 else "c"

    # Compound data types
    list_variable[0] # Access item by index
    dict_variable[key] # Access item by key
    object.attribute # Access object attribute

    # Supported custom functions
    len(obj: Any) -> int # Return number of items of a compound variable
    regex(pattern: str) -> Pattern # Creates a regex pattern that can be compared to
    search(pattern: str, string: str) -> bool # Check for regex pattern in string
    findall(pattern: str, string: str) -> List[str] # Return all matches of regex pattern with string
    uid() -> str # Create new universal unique identifier
    int(string: str) -> int # Convert the number in the string to an int
    float(string: str) -> float # Convert the number in the string to a float
    str(x: Any) -> str # Convert x to a string
    pretty_str(x: Any) -> str # Convert x to a formatted string
    int(x: Any) -> int # Convert x to a int
    float(x: Any) -> float # Convert x to a float
    escape(string: str) -> str # Escape a string and expressions inside the string
    is_bool(x: Any) -> bool # Check if x is a bool
    is_int(x: Any) -> bool # Check if x is an int
    is_float(x: Any) -> bool # Check if x is a float
    is_str(x: Any) -> bool # Check if x is a str
    is_regex(x: Any) -> bool # Check if x is a regex pattern
    rand() -> float # Return a random float between 0 and 1
    randint(x: int) -> int # Return a random int below x
    flows_info() -> dict # Returns a dictionary that contains more information about the current flow

Here is how expression can be used withing Colang:

.. code-block:: colang

    # Expression in an assignment
    $dict = {"value": 2 + 3}

    # Expression as standalone statement
    ($dict.update({"value": 4}))

    # Expression as a flow parameter
    bot count to ($dict["value"])

You see how expressions can be used in different context and need to be wrapped in parentheses if used as a *standalone statement* or as a *flow parameter*.


----------------------------------------
Flow Variable Access
----------------------------------------

By default variables defined in a flow have a local scope and are not accessible from outside the flow. One way to enable access to them is by declaring them as flow attributes using the notation shown in :ref:`defining-flows` in the flow definition:

.. code-block:: colang
    :caption: variables/flow_attributes/main.co

    flow main
        await user said something as $ref
        await UtteranceBotAction(script=$ref.transcript)
        match AnEvent()

    flow user said something -> $transcript
        match UtteranceUserAction.Finished() as $event_ref
        $transcript = $event_ref.final_transcript

With this we can e.g. access the user transcript and use it to repeat it with a bot utterance action.

Another way to share information between flows using variables is to make it global by using the keyword ``global``.

.. code-block:: colang
    :caption: variables/global_variables/main.co

    flow main
        global $transcript
        await bot said something
        await UtteranceBotAction(script=$transcript)
        match AnEvent()

    flow bot said something
        global $transcript
        match UtteranceUserAction.Finished() as $event_ref
        $transcript = $event_ref.final_transcript

As you can see from the example, we need to define in each flow that the variable ``$transcript`` is global in order to get access to the global instance. Otherwise, it would be a local variable hiding the global instance. But please think twice about using global variables as it can be an indication of a non-optimal Colang design.

----------------------------------------
Expressions in Strings
----------------------------------------

As in Python's formatted string literals we can use braces to evaluate an expression inside a string ``"{$variable}"``:

.. code-block:: colang
    :caption: variables/string_expression_evaluation/main.co

    flow main
        $user_name = "John"
        await UtteranceBotAction(script="Hi {$user_name}!")
        match AnEvent()

If you need to include a brace character in the literal text, it can be escaped by doubling: ``{{`` and ``}}``.

----------------------------------------
Built-in Flow Variables
----------------------------------------

.. important::
    This is work in progress and some of the built-in variables might change or be removed in the future.

Currently, there are a couple of variable names that cannot be used as custom variable names in a flow. They contain flow instance specific information:

.. code-block:: colang

    $system: dict # System specific data like e.g. the current bot configuration `$system.config`
    $uid: str # The unique id of the flow instance
    $flow_id: str # The name of the current flow
    $loop_id: Optional[str] # The interaction loop id of the current flow
    $parent_uid: Optional[str] # The unique id of the parent flow instance
    $child_flow_uids: List[str] # All unique ids of the child flow instances
    $context: dict # The current variable context that contains all user defined variables in the flow
    $priority: float # Current priority of the flow
    $arguments: dict # All arguments of the flow
    $flow_instance_uid: str # Flow instance specific uid
    $source_flow_instance_uid: str # The parent flow uid of the flow
    $activate: bool # True if the flow was activated and will therefore restart immediately when finished
    $new_instance_started: bool # True if new instance was started of an activated flow

    # Other internal flow members that cannot be used:
    $hierarchy_position, $heads, $scopes, $head_fork_uids, $action_uids, $global_variables,
    $status_updated, $source_head_uid

Next we learn how to use :ref:`flow-control` to create branching or looping interaction patterns.
