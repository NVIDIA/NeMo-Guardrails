# Demo Use Case

Before proceeding any further, let's choose a concrete use case to guide our discussions. We'll consider a fictional company, the *ABC Company*, and create a bot, the *ABC Bot*, that assists employees by providing information on the organization's employee handbook and policies. This will help us better understand the practical applications of NeMo Guardrails.

In the following guides, we'll go through a step-by-step configuration process, addressing various challenges that may arise. If you're new to NeMo Guardrails, it's recommended to follow the guides in order. Otherwise, feel free to jump to the guide that interests you most.

1. [Input moderation](../4_input_rails): Verify that any user input is safe before proceeding.
2. [Output moderation](../5_output_rails): Ensure that the bot's output is not offensive and does not include specific words.
3. [Preventing off-topic questions](../6_topical_rails): Guarantee that the bot only responds to specific topics.
4. [Retrieval augmented generation](../7_rag): Integrate external knowledge bases.
5. [Fact-checking](../8_fact_checking): Ensure that the responses are factual.
6. [Calling external tools](../9_external_tools): Call external tools, such as math computation.

## Next

Next, we start with adding [Input Moderation](../4_input_rails) to the ABC Bot.
