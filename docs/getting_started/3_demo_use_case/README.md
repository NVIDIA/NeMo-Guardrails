# Demo Use Case

This topic describes a use case used in the remaining guide topics. The use case defines a fictional company, *ABC Company*, with a bot, the *ABC Bot*, that assists employees by providing information on the organization's employee handbook and policies. The remaining topics in this guide use this example to explain a practical application of NeMo Guardrails.

The following guide topics lead you through a step-by-step configuration process, addressing various challenges that might arise.

1. [Input moderation](../4_input_rails): Verify that any user input is safe before proceeding.
2. [Output moderation](../5_output_rails): Ensure that the bot's output is not offensive and does not include specific words.
3. [Preventing off-topic questions](../6_topical_rails): Guarantee that the bot only responds to specific topics.
4. [Retrieval augmented generation](../7_rag): Integrate external knowledge bases.

## Next

Start with adding [Input Moderation](../4_input_rails) to the ABC Bot.
