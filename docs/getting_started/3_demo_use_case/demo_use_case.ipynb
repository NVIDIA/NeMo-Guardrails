    "\n",
    "1. [Input moderation](../4_input_rails): Verify that any user input is safe before proceeding. \n",
    "2. [Output moderation](../5_output_rails): Ensure that the bot's output is not offensive and does not include specific words. \n",
    "3. [Preventing off-topic questions](../6_topical_rails): Guarantee that the bot only responds to specific topics.\n",
    "4. [Retrieval augmented generation](../7_rag): Integrate external knowledge bases. \n",
