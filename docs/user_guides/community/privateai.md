# Private AI Integration

[Private AI](https://docs.private-ai.com) allows you to detect and mask Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in your data. This integration enables NeMo Guardrails to use Private AI for PII detection in input, output and retrieval flows.

## Setup

1. Ensure that you have access to Private AI API server running locally or in the cloud. To get started with the cloud version, you can use the [Private AI Portal](https://portal.private-ai.com). For containerized deployments, check out this [Quickstart Guide](http://docs.private-ai.com/quickstart/?utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=nemo-guardrails).

2. Update your `config.yml` file to include the Private AI settings:

```yaml
rails:
  config:
    privateai:
      server_endpoint: http://your-privateai-api-endpoint/process/text  # Replace this with your Private AI process text endpoint
      api_key: your-privateai-api-key  # Optional: Not needed for the containerized version
      input:
        entities:  # If no entity is specified here, all supported entities will be detected by default.
          - NAME_FAMILY
          - LOCATION_ADDRESS_STREET
          - EMAIL_ADDRESS
      output:
        entities:
          - NAME_FAMILY
          - LOCATION_ADDRESS_STREET
          - EMAIL_ADDRESS
  input:
    flows:
      - detect pii on input
  output:
    flows:
      - detect pii on output
```

Replace `http://your-privateai-api-endpoint/process/text` with your actual Private AI process text endpoint.

3. You can customize the `entities` list under both `input` and `output` to include the PII types you want to detect. A full list of supported entities can be found [here](http://docs.private-ai.com/entities/?utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=nemo-guardrails).

## Usage

Once configured, the Private AI integration will automatically:

1. Detect PII in user inputs before they are processed by the LLM.
2. Detect PII in LLM outputs before they are sent back to the user.
3. Detect PII in retrieved chunks before they are sent to the LLM.

The `detect_pii` action in `nemoguardrails/library/privateai/actions.py` handles the PII detection process.

## Customization

You can customize the PII detection behavior by modifying the `entities` lists in the `config.yml` file. Refer to the Private AI documentation for a complete list of [supported entity types](http://docs.private-ai.com/entities/?utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=nemo-guardrails).

## Error Handling

If the Private AI detection API request fails, the system will assume PII is present as a precautionary measure.

## Notes

- Ensure that your Private AI process text endpoint is properly set up and accessible from your NeMo Guardrails environment.
- The integration currently supports PII detection only.
