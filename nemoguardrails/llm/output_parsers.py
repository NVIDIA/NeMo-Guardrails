    - If the response contains "unsafe" or "yes", the content is deemed unsafe.
    - If the response contains "no", the content is deemed safe.

    Note: If you are using this function for a different task with a custom prompt, ensure to update the logic to match the new context.
    Here, "yes" implies the content should be blocked, is unsafe, or violates a policy, while "no" implies the content is safe or does not violate any policy.


    For example, in the `self_check_facts` action, we have a different interpretation.
    Here, "yes" indicates the content is safe. This is against the default logic of the `is_content_safe` function.
    Therefore, we invert the result of `is_content_safe` to align with this interpretation.
    If `is_content_safe` returns `False` (content is safe), `result` will be `0.0`. If `is_content_safe` returns `True` (content is unsafe), `result` will be `1.0`.
