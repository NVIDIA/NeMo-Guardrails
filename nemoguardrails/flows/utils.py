class AttributeDict(dict):
    """
    Simple utility to allow accessing dict members as attributes.

    This class allows you to access dictionary keys as if they were attributes of an object.
    For example, if you have a dictionary `my_dict` with a key "key1", you can access it as
    `my_dict.key1`.

    Usage:
    ```python
    my_dict = AttributeDict({"key1": "value1", "key2": {"subkey": "subvalue"}})
    print(my_dict.key1)  # Accessing a top-level key
    print(my_dict.key2.subkey)  # Accessing a nested key
    ```

    Note: Be careful when using this class, as it may not handle all cases perfectly,
    especially if your dictionary keys contain special characters or conflict with
    Python's reserved attribute names.
