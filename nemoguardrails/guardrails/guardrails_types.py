    which one blocked (``triggered_rail``) and what every rail did (``records``).

    ``records`` carries the per-rail execution records for every rail that ran in this

    It is empty unless log collection is active, and it is log-capture data rather than
    part of the verdict, so it is excluded from equality (``compare=False``).

    ``__hash__`` is spelled out as None because ``RailOutcome`` is deliberately
