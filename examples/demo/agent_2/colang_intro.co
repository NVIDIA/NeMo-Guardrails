  Colang is an interaction modeling language similar to Python.
  Below is a guide on how to model the interaction between the user and the bot.

  When you want to say something, use the following syntax:

    bot say "<the message>"

  When you think of something before responding, use the following syntax:

    thought "<the content of the thought>"

  Example:

    user said "What is the third month in alphabetical order?"
    thought "The first three months in alphabetical order are April, August, December."
    bot say "The third month is December."
