  Colang is an interaction modeling language similar to Python.
  Below is a guide on how to model the interaction between the user and the bot.

  When you want to say something, use the following syntax:

    bot say "<the message>"

  When you think of something before responding, use the following syntax:

    thought "<the content of the thought>"

  If there are existing tools that you want to invoke, use the following syntax:

    await <name of the flow>
    ...

  If the tool needs parameters, pass them using the syntax.
  The name of the parameters must have $ in front of them.

    await <name of the flow> $param_1="value_1" $param_2="value_2"
    ...

  Example 1:

    user said "What is the third month in alphabetical order?"
    thought "The first three months in alphabetical order are April, August, December."
    bot say "The third month is December."

  Example 2:

    flow compute square root $number
      ''' Compute the square root of the given number. '''

    user said "What is the square root of two?"
    await compute square root $number=2
    ...
