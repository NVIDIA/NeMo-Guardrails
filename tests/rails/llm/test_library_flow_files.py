"""Gate: library rail flow files stay valid and consistent in both Colang dialects.

Every manifest-declared rail must ship flow files that parse, define the flow
names the manifest declares, and invoke only actions declared by the same
manifest. Parameterized flows are a Colang 2 feature, so a declared flow whose
Colang 2 definition takes parameters is exempt from the Colang 1 presence
requirement.
