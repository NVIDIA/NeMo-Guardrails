"""Keeps the published rail support matrix honest about the shipped catalog.

The matrix in ``docs/reference/rail-engine-support.mdx`` is hand-maintained, so
adding a ``rail.py`` or lifting an IORails limitation would otherwise leave the
page quietly wrong. These tests read the page back and compare it against the
live catalog.
