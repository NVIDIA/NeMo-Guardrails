# Demonstrates how to react to user utterances while waiting for another event like a LLM request answer.
# Question: would the 'bot ask and respond' flow abort for user 'said something' FlowFinished event from a different parallel flow?
# -> Not if we use the sensitive flow set definition based on the current flow heads

# include core_flows.co
