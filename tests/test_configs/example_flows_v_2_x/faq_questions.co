# Demonstrates a simple faq handling while having a conversation in the main flow
# If the user asks an faq the main flow will be interrupted and the faq answered before returning to the main flow

# TODO:
# Show how after the FAQ the main flow can be resumed at a meaningful position to e.g. give context:
# - User injection flows (see flow_insertion.co)
# - User resume labels

# user faq intents

flow user asked something
  await user said "what|why|where|when|who|which|how"

flow user asked about service
  await user said "What are you offering"
    or user said "What services do you provide"

flow user asked about bot name
  await user said "what's your name?"
    or user said "tell me your name"

flow user asked where are the toilettes
  await user said "I need to go to the toilettes"

# **Use case**

# Current heads:
# - main/match 'user said "good"'
# - main/match 'user said "bad"'
# - user asked how are you multi turn response/match user ask how are you
# - Many flow .../'match user said ...'
# - Many 'user said ...'/'match UtteranceBotAction(...).Finished()'
# Active flows:
# - main
#   - user said "good"
#   - user said "bad"
# Paused flows: None

# -> Event: match UtteranceBotAction.Finished("how are you")
# One head in wrapper flow matching exactly (1.0) -> match -> advance
# One head in wrapper flow matching fuzzily (0.9) -> match -> advance
# Multiple heads in wrapper flows matching event but not parameter -> no match -> pause (since we have some matches)
# Active flows:
# - faq question handling
#   - user asked something response/'user say "how are you"'
#   - user asked how are you multi turn response/user asked something
# Paused flows: main

# Two advancing wrapper flow finish and trigger FlowFinished events
# Two matches of 'user said ...' in 'user asked something' and 'user asked how are you multi turn response'
# Both flows advance bot will disagree on actions started by child flows 'bot say ...'
# Action conflict resolution:
# - 'user asked something' is aborted since its 'bot say ...' is aborted and will restart
# - Flow 'user asked how are you multi turn response' advances successfully executing 'bot say "Good! And you?"'
# Flow 'user asked how are you multi turn response' will advance further to 'user said "good"'
# Active flows:
# - faq question handling/user asked how are you multi turn response/'user said "good"'
# Paused flows: main

# -> Event: match UtteranceBotAction.Finished("good")
# One head in wrapper flow matching exactly (1.0) -> match -> advance
# One head in wrapper flow matching fuzzily (0.9) -> match -> advance
# Multiple heads in wrapper flows matching event but not parameter -> no match -> pause (since we have some matches)
# the main flow and all its child flows (activated excluded) are paused and therefore have no matches
# We have an action conflict as before and will advance finally with 'user asked how are you multi turn response'
# The end of that flow will resume the main flow with all it's previously active children

#flow main
#- activate faq question handling
#  - activate user asked ...
#    * await user said ...
