# Processing steps log:

# --> event: StartFlowInternalEvent("main")
# start flow a -> generate internal event `StartFlow("a")`
# start flow b -> generate internal event `StartFlow("b")`
# start flow g -> generate internal event `StartFlow("g")`

# --> event: StartFlow("a")
# start flow 'start bot say "Flow a"' -> generate internal event `start bot say "Flow a"`
# start flow 'user said something' -> generate internal event `StartFlow("user said something")`
# head: 'match user said something'

# --> event: StartFlow("b")
# start flow 'start bot say "Flow b"' -> generate internal event `start bot say "Flow b"`
# start flow 'user said "Hi"' -> generate internal event `StartFlow('user said "Hi"')`
# head: 'match user said "Hi"'

# --> event: StartFlow("g")
# head: 'match c.Started()'

# --> event: StartFlow(`start bot say "Flow a"`)
# send UtteranceBotAction("Flow a").Start
# head: match UtteranceBotAction("Flow a").Finished

# --> event: StartFlow("user said something")
# start the 'user said something' flow
# head: match UtteranceUserAction().Finished

# --> event: StartFlow(`start bot say "Flow b"`)
# send UtteranceBotAction("Flow b").Start
# head: match UtteranceBotAction("Flow b").Finished

# --> event: StartFlow('user said "Hi"')
# start the 'user said "Hi"' flow
# head: 'match UtteranceUserAction("Hi").Finished'

# Comment: that all these previous actions did not create a conflict since they are in a clear sequential processing order:
# System action summary based on wrapper flows:
# - bot say "Flow a"
# - bot say "Flow b"
# Now we have both heads of flow a and b at the match statement for FlowFinished event of 'user said something' and 'user said "Hi"'

# --> event: UtteranceUserAction.Finished("Hi")
# Will finish both 'user said something' / 'user said "Hi"' flows simultaneously (same processing group id)
# The match statements in flow a / b trigger simultaneously
# Same statements 'start bot say "Ok"' (no conflict) -> generate one internal event `StartFlow('start bot say "Ok"')`
# Starting flow c / d is not pattern relevant (no conflict) -> generate both internal 'StartFlow' events
# Starting flow e / f is not pattern relevant (no conflict) -> generate both internal 'StartFlow' events
# 'flow a' head: 'match c' / 'flow b' head: 'match d'

# Comment: flow e and f get started since flow a and b are still agreeing on the pattern ('start flow' statements are not pattern relevant, only sending events (actions))

# Same statements: 'start bot say "Now"' -> no conflict
# Different statements: 'await bot say "1"' / 'await bot say "2"' -> will create a action conflict in the underlying wrapper flows
# 'flow c' head: match bot say "1" / 'flow d' head: match bot say "2"
# The action in statement 'await bot say "2"' will win since the initial match in flow b had higher score as it was more specific
# Flow 'bot say "1"' gets aborted/fails
# Flow 'bot say "2"' finished successfully
# Match statement 'match bot say "1"' fails -> flow c fails
# Match statement 'match bot say "2"' succeeds -> flow d finished
# 'flow c' gets aborted
# 'match c' statement will fail since c failed -> flow a is aborted/failed
# 'match d' statement will match since d finished in same time processing windows -> flow b finished successfully

# Comment: Underlying actions in flow e / f agree and will therefore be executed without a conflict (only once of course)
