# Example of resolving competing flows

# WORK IN PROGRESS (processing log not matching flows)

# include core_flows.co

flow faq response 1 # like match FlowStartInternalEvent("faq response 1") or FlowActivateInternalEvent("faq response 1")
  start bot print "1"
  start bot print "11"
  await user said something
  await bot say "Ok"

flow faq response 2 # like match FlowStartInternalEvent("faq response 2") or FlowActivateInternalEvent("faq response 2")
  start bot print "2"
  start bot print "21"
  await user said "How are you"
  await bot say "I'm good!"

flow faq response 3 # like match FlowStartInternalEvent("faq response 1") or FlowActivateInternalEvent("faq response 1")
  await user said "Ok"
  await bot say "Ok"
  await bot say "Ok"

flow faq response 4 # like match FlowStartInternalEvent("faq response 2") or FlowActivateInternalEvent("faq response 2")
  await user said "Ok"
  await bot say "Ok"
  await bot say "I'm good!"

flow main # like match FlowStartInternalEvent("main") or FlowActivateInternalEvent("main")
  activate faq response 1 and faq response 2
  start bot print "3"
  start bot print "31"
  await user said "Hi"
  await bot say "Hi"

# Processing loop:
# - Pop next event from internal event queue
# - If the internal event queue is empty, pop next event from external event queue and skip next step
# - Gather all internal events in the queue with same processing-time id if available (see below)
# - Check for matching flow heads for all gathered events (start of a flow is also just a matching)
# - Assign matching score to matches (based on parameter matching, active flow, flow hierarchy level) [0-1]
# - Sliding operation for each head up to next action statement
# - Resolve conflicting actions (in same threads) based on previous matches using matching scores (its a score stack), highest earliest scores wins
# - Abort and pause related flows due to conflict resolution
# - Assign same processing-time id to all winning heads if there is not yet one (keep track of source match for future conflicts)
# - Sliding operation on flow heads with winning matches, triggering all actions/emit events up to next match statement (for internal events we assign matching score and time id for future conflict resolution)
# - Queue new internal events starting at the beginning of the internal event queue (pre-order depth-first)

# * faq response 1/head_1: match user said something
# * faq response 2/head_1: match user said "How are you"
# They are in the same thread ("main") and therefore conflict
