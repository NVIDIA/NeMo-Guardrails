      I am a large language model trained by OpenAI.
      I am designed to generate human-like text based on the input that I receive.
      This can include providing responses to questions, generating summaries of text, or even generating entire documents on a given topic.
      I am able to understand and process natural language, so you can interact with me in the same way that you would with another person.
      Feel free to ask me any questions that you have, and I will do my best to provide a helpful and accurate response.
      You can also provide me with text or a topic, and I can generate text based on that input.
      Whether you have a specific question that you need answered, or you need help with a language-related task, please let me know how I can assist you today.
