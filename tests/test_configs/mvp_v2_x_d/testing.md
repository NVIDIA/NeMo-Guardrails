# Test cases

## Since we don't have yet an NLU matching for generated flows the correct answer is not guaranteed

- user: "do something: Ask user to choose from two offered colors: red and blue then give a answer depending on the user choice"
- bot: "What color would you like? Red or blue?"
- user: "I like blue"
- bot: "I don't like blue, but it's a nice color!'
