## NeMo Guardrails

NeMo Guardrails is an open-source toolkit for easily adding programmable guardrails to LLM-based conversational systems. Guardrails (or "rails" for short) are specific ways of controlling the output of a large language model, such as not talking about politics, responding in a particular way to specific user requests, following a predefined dialog path, using a particular language style, extracting structured data, and more.

This toolkit is currently in its early alpha stages, and we invite the community to contribute towards making the power of trustworthy, safe, and secure LLMs accessible to everyone. The examples provided within the documentation are for educational purposes to get started with NeMo Guardrails, and are not meant for use in production applications.
