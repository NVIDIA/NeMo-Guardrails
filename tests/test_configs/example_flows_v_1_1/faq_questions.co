# Demonstrates a simple faq handling while having a conversation in the main flow
# If the user asks an faq the main flow will be interrupted and the faq answered before returning to the main flow

# TODO:
# Show how after the FAQ the main flow can be resumed at a meaningful position to e.g. give context:
# - User injection flows (see flow_insertion.co)
# - User resume labels

# user faq intents

# **Use case**

# Current heads:
# - main/match 'user said "good"'
# - main/match 'user said "bad"'
# - user asked how are you multi turn response/match user ask how are you
# - Many flow .../'match user said ...'
# - Many 'user said ...'/'match UtteranceBotAction(...).Finished()'
# Active flows:
# - main
#   - user said "good"
#   - user said "bad"
# Paused flows: None

# -> Event: match UtteranceBotAction.Finished("how are you")
# One head in wrapper flow matching exactly (1.0) -> match -> advance
# One head in wrapper flow matching fuzzily (0.9) -> match -> advance
# Multiple heads in wrapper flows matching event but not parameter -> no match -> pause (since we have some matches)
# Active flows:
# - faq question handling
#   - user asked something response/'user say "how are you"'
#   - user asked how are you multi turn response/user asked something
# Paused flows: main

# Two advancing wrapper flow finish and trigger FlowFinished events
# Two matches of 'user said ...' in 'user asked something' and 'user asked how are you multi turn response'
# Both flows advance bot will disagree on actions started by child flows 'bot say ...'
# Action conflict resolution:
# - 'user asked something' is aborted since its 'bot say ...' is aborted and will restart
# - Flow 'user asked how are you multi turn response' advances successfully executing 'bot say "Good! And you?"'
# Flow 'user asked how are you multi turn response' will advance further to 'user said "good"'
# Active flows:
# - faq question handling/user asked how are you multi turn response/'user said "good"'
# Paused flows: main

# -> Event: match UtteranceBotAction.Finished("good")
# One head in wrapper flow matching exactly (1.0) -> match -> advance
# One head in wrapper flow matching fuzzily (0.9) -> match -> advance
# Multiple heads in wrapper flows matching event but not parameter -> no match -> pause (since we have some matches)
# the main flow and all its child flows (activated excluded) are paused and therefore have no matches
# We have an action conflict as before and will advance finally with 'user asked how are you multi turn response'
# The end of that flow will resume the main flow with all it's previously active children
