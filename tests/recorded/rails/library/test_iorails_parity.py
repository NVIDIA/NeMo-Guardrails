"""IORails replayed against the cassettes the LLMRails suite recorded.

Each test here mirrors one in a sibling module, same config and same messages, and replays
that test's cassette through ``Guardrails`` with IORails selected. No new recordings: the
question is whether the two engines read one provider response the same way, so reusing the
recorded response is what makes the comparison meaningful.

Both status *and* content are asserted on every case. A rail error becomes a block through the
fail-closed envelope, so a cassette that fails to replay produces a plausible-looking
``BLOCKED`` with the right rail name -- asserting only the status would pass against a
completely broken cassette.

Rail naming differs by engine and is pinned in
``test_the_rail_name_drops_its_surface_parameter_on_iorails``.
