# Recorded Tests

Recorded tests replay provider traffic through pytest-recording cassettes and must run without live network access by default.

A test belongs in this suite only if it sends at least one real provider
request; deterministic tests (local actions, injected generators, input
validation) go in `tests/`. See `.agents/skills/recorded-tests/SKILL.md` for
the placement rules.

## Adding a test

Markers are applied once per module via `pytestmark`; do not stack `@pytest.mark.recorded` / `vcr` / `asyncio` on each test. Use a module-level list, and fold in `vcr`/`asyncio` only when every test in the module needs them:

```python
import pytest

from nemoguardrails import LLMRails
from tests.recorded.rails.public_api.configs import OPENAI_BASELINE_CONFIG
from tests.recorded.rails_config import load_config
from tests.recorded.snapshots import snapshot

pytestmark = [pytest.mark.recorded, pytest.mark.vcr, pytest.mark.asyncio]


async def test_my_case(openai_api_key):
    rails = LLMRails(load_config(OPENAI_BASELINE_CONFIG), verbose=False)
    result = await rails.generate_async(prompt="...")
    assert result == snapshot()
```

Config constants (``OPENAI_BASELINE_CONFIG`` and friends) live in the suite-local
``configs.py`` next to the tests; ``snapshot`` is the suite-local re-export in
``tests/recorded/snapshots.py``, not ``inline_snapshot`` directly.

Request credentials as fixture parameters (`openai_api_key`, `nvidia_api_key`) rather than calling `request.getfixturevalue(...)`. In modules that mix sync/async tests or vcr/non-vcr tests, keep only `recorded` in `pytestmark` and apply `@pytest.mark.vcr` / `@pytest.mark.asyncio` per test. Then use the Makefile refresh workflow to record once with credentials, fill the snapshot offline, and verify the replay:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... make record-cassettes \
  RECORDED_TESTS=path::test_my_case \
  RECORDED_REQUIRED_KEYS=OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## Negative paths

This suite owns **pipeline-level** failures (how `LLMRails` behaves when a model call
fails) and **public-API input validation**. Client/wire-level conditions (status code to
exception mapping, retries, SSE, malformed bodies) belong in `tests/llm/clients/`, which
covers them with `httpx.MockTransport` + JSON fixtures; do not duplicate them here.

Prefer mechanisms in this order:

1. **Recordable real error** (refreshable cassette). A nonexistent model name yields a real,
   deterministic 404, so error paths record and refresh like any happy path. Use a config
   whose model is invalid (see `OPENAI_INVALID_MODEL_CONFIG`,
   `CONTENT_SAFETY_INVALID_MODEL_CONFIG`).
2. **Pure runtime** `pytest.raises` for input validation (no cassette, no transport).
3. **Fake cassette** (`@pytest.mark.fake_cassette`) only as a last resort, for a synthetic
   response that must flow through the full pipeline and cannot be reproduced by 1 or 2.

Observed behavior these tests pin: a failing model call (main *or* a rail's own model)
propagates as `LLMCallException` — a safety-model failure does not let content through
silently. Name negative tests `test_<surface>_<failure>_<behavior>` with the suffixes
`_raises` / `_fails_closed` / `_invalid_*` so they are greppable
(`pytest -k "raises or invalid"`), and co-locate each with its happy-path sibling module.

## Replay

```bash
uv run pytest tests/recorded --block-network -v --durations=10
```

Focused rails replay:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/recorded/rails/public_api --block-network -v
uv run pytest tests/recorded/rails/library --block-network -v
```

Replay mode installs dummy API keys from `tests/recorded/utils.py`. A cassette miss with `--block-network` is a test failure.

## Refresh

Refresh only in a trusted environment with real provider credentials. The
record -> fill-snapshots -> verify loop is wrapped in make targets.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... NVIDIA_API_KEY=... make record-cassettes
```

`record-cassettes` defaults to `RECORDED_RECORD_MODE=once` and
`RECORDED_SNAPSHOT_MODE=create`, which records missing cassettes, fills empty
snapshots, and replays existing cassettes. This is the safest mode when adding
new tests because it will not rewrite unrelated existing cassettes selected by
the same path.

For a focused new cassette that only touches one provider, pass the test node and
override the preflight list:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... make record-cassettes \
  RECORDED_TESTS=tests/recorded/rails/public_api/test_generate.py::test_new_case \
  RECORDED_REQUIRED_KEYS=OPENAI_API_KEY
```

`RECORDED_TESTS` is passed directly to pytest, so it can be a single test, a
test class, several files, or a directory:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... make record-cassettes \
  RECORDED_TESTS="tests/recorded/rails/public_api/test_generate.py tests/recorded/clients/test_openai_chat.py" \
  RECORDED_REQUIRED_KEYS=OPENAI_API_KEY
```

For an intentional rewrite of existing cassettes, use `rewrite-cassettes`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... make rewrite-cassettes \
  RECORDED_TESTS=tests/recorded/rails/public_api/test_generate.py::test_openai_generate_async_public_contract \
  RECORDED_REQUIRED_KEYS=OPENAI_API_KEY
```

`rewrite-cassettes` uses `RECORDED_RECORD_MODE=rewrite` and
`RECORDED_SNAPSHOT_MODE=fix`, so changed recorded outputs update existing inline
snapshots before the final offline replay verification.

For a full trusted refresh, set the record mode explicitly:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... NVIDIA_API_KEY=... make record-cassettes RECORDED_RECORD_MODE=all RECORDED_SNAPSHOT_MODE=fix
```

Replay and snapshot-only workflows do not need real provider credentials:

```bash
make replay-cassettes RECORDED_TESTS=tests/recorded/rails/public_api/test_generate.py::test_openai_generate_async_public_contract
make snapshot-cassettes RECORDED_TESTS=tests/recorded/rails/public_api/test_generate.py::test_openai_generate_async_public_contract
```

## Cassettes

Rails tests use pytest-recording's default names:

```text
tests/recorded/rails/<suite>/cassettes/<test_module>/<test_name>.yaml
```

Parameterized tests include the parameter id in the cassette filename. Every test (rails and clients) uses this default naming; do not add `@pytest.mark.default_cassette(...)`.

JSON request and response bodies are stored as `parsed_body` and rehydrated by `ReadableYamlSerializer` during replay. SSE responses also use parseable `parsed_body` events.

Cassettes preserve scrubbed JSON text without smart-character normalization so provider payloads stay inspectable. Request matching and snapshot helpers normalize smart quotes, dash variants, ellipses, and NFKC at comparison time. Response headers are dropped by exact name and by prefix (`x-`, `cf-`, `openai-`); `tests/recorded/sanitization.py` holds the `ALLOWED_HEADERS` exceptions that must survive the prefix sweep (currently `content-type`).

Inspect a cassette:

```bash
uv run python -m tests.recorded.inspect_cassette tests/recorded/rails/public_api/cassettes/test_stream/test_openai_stream_async_public_contract.yaml
```

## Snapshots

Rails replay outputs are pinned with inline snapshots after normalization. Create or fix snapshots with:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/recorded/rails --block-network --inline-snapshot=create
uv run pytest tests/recorded/rails --block-network --inline-snapshot=fix
uv run pytest tests/recorded/rails --block-network --inline-snapshot=review
```

Snapshot formatting uses `ruff format` through `[tool.inline-snapshot]` in `pyproject.toml`.
Snapshot create/fix/review runs must be serial. Use `make record-cassettes` or a
direct `uv run pytest ... --inline-snapshot=<mode>` command; the default
`make test` path uses xdist, where inline-snapshot disables update and report
modes.

How inline snapshots actually behave (so the workflow does not surprise you):

- `--inline-snapshot=create`/`fix` REWRITES THE TEST FILE in place, filling
  `snapshot()` with the observed value. The resulting diff to your own test
  is the expected outcome; review it, do not revert it. The same run still
  reports a teardown error ("the value is now created and you can ignore
  this message"); a `1 passed, 1 error` result on a create run is normal.
- An unfilled `snapshot()` never passes silently: under serial runs the test
  passes but errors at teardown ("your snapshot is missing one value");
  under xdist (`make test`) the comparison itself fails. Either way, fill it
  serially or via the make targets.
- Always snapshot the NORMALIZED form
  (`assert normalize_*(...) == snapshot(...)`, helpers in
  `tests/recorded/normalization.py`); snapshotting raw responses churns on
  every refresh despite cassette scrubbing.

Volatile response fields (ids, timestamps, fingerprints) are scrubbed to fixed sentinels in the cassette, so snapshots assert them directly without needing loose matchers.

## Fake Outputs

Prefer `FakeLLMModel` when a test needs the main model to emit a specific output and provider-backed rail/task calls can still replay from VCR. This keeps the test refreshable.

Use a fake cassette only when runtime injection cannot model the behavior clearly, such as a provider stream/error path. Fake cassettes must:

- live under a `cassettes/**/fake/` directory,
- use `@pytest.mark.fake_cassette`,
- be excluded from refresh with `-m "not fake_cassette"`,
- include YAML header metadata with `reason`, `frozen_fields`, and `fake_llm_model_considered`.

The fake-cassette metadata validator is in `tests/recorded/fake_cassettes.py`.
